### Proof of concept for content (`Entry`) Changeset creation. 
- Uses Contentful Delivery API to fetch all data (higher rate limits).
- Uses `auto` throttling to calculate max amount of possible requests per second.
- Custom CDA Client to execute requests on different environments in parallel. 
- Detects possibly diverged entities based on `sys.changedAt` property.
- Flexible output for `added` entries (`Link` to source entry or full entry payload)
- Batches all requests

# Statistics

Identical environments
```
Created a new changeset for 2 environments with 2965 source entities and 2965 target entities.
The resulting changeset has 0 removed, 0 added and 0 changed entries.
0 entities were detected with a different sys.changedAt date, but were identical.
Overall 62 CDA and 0 CMA request were fired within 8.6 seconds.
```

Empty `target` environment (`Link`)
```
Created a new changeset for 2 environments with 2965 source entities and 0 target entities.
The resulting changeset has 0 removed, 2965 added and 0 changed entries.
0 entities were detected with a different sys.changedAt date, but were identical.
Overall 32 CDA and 0 CMA request were fired within 4.3 seconds.
```

Empty `target` environment (full payload)
```
Created a new changeset for 2 environments with 2965 source entities and 0 target entities.
The resulting changeset has 0 removed, 2965 added and 0 changed entries.
0 entities were detected with a different sys.changedAt date, but were identical.
Overall 62 CDA and 0 CMA request were fired within 16.1 seconds.
```

Empty `source` environment
```
Created a new changeset for 2 environments with 0 source entities and 2965 target entities.
The resulting changeset has 2965 removed, 0 added and 0 changed entries.
0 entities were detected with a different sys.changedAt date, but were identical.
Overall 32 CDA and 0 CMA request were fired within 4.4 seconds.
```

Diverged Environments with `199` changed entries
```
Created a new changeset for 2 environments with 2965 source entities and 2966 target entities.
The resulting changeset has 1 removed, 0 added and 199 changed entries.
0 entities were detected with a different sys.changedAt date, but were identical.
Overall 66 CDA and 0 CMA request were fired within 10.0 seconds.
```

### Next steps
- General
  - [ ] more entities (`Asset`, `EditorInterface`, `ContentType`)
  - [ ] more logging
- Create
  - [ ] use worker thread to compute ids
- Apply
  - [ ] Gracefully fail when change not applicable
  - [x] General result message
  - [ ] Apply Changeset to target environment, following the right order.
