## Introduction

**Contentful**

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) provides content infrastructure for digital teams to power websites, apps, and devices. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enables developers and content creators to ship their products faster.

**Contentful Merge**

The <b>contentful-merge</b> CLI tool lets you compare entries across environments. It tells you how many entries are in the source and target environments, and how many of those have been added, deleted or updated. A detailed changeset is saved in a file.

### :warning: This project is still in beta :warning:
This means:
- Use at your own risk! It might still be a bit rough around the edges, and we might introduce breaking changes.
- We want to know how people are using this tool, so that we can prioritize what to focus on next. We therefore collect some [analytics](src/analytics/index.ts) data.
- <b>We would love your feedback!</b> [Here](https://forms.gle/uVj4sG2jKmQHotRd6) is a form where you can tell us about your experience and let us know which additional features you would like.

## Features

Takes a space id and two environment ids and creates a changeset which details all entry differences between the two environments.
- It uses the [Contentful Delivery API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/) (CDA) to fetch all data.
- A custom CDA client executes requests in the  different environments in parallel.
- All requests are batched.
- In order to identify <b>added</b> and <b>removed</b> entries, entry ids are compared in both environments.
- In order to identify <b>changed</b> entries, comparison happens in two steps:
  The initial step involves identifying potentially diverging entries by examining the `sys.changedAt` property of all entries present in both environments.
  Subsequently, for all entries with distinct `sys.changedAt` values, a more comprehensive comparison of their payload is performed. If any variations are found, a patch is generated to reflect the differences.

> We got you covered: Take a look at the [Merge App](https://www.contentful.com/marketplace/app/merge/) to your space, or, if you prefer the command line, check out the [Merge CLI](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli/tree/master/docs/merge).

## Data structure

> ⚠️ As this project is still in beta, the data structure might still change down the line ⚠️

The created changeset will be saved in JSON format in a file called `changeset.json` in the directory that you run the command in. It has the following basic structure: 
```javascript
{
  "sys": {
    "type": "Changeset",
    "entityType": "Entry",
    "createdAt": "<date of changeset creation>",
    "version": 1,
    "source": {
      "sys": {
        "id": "<source environment id>",
        "linkType": "Environment",
        "type": "Link"
      }
    },
    "target": {
      "sys": {
        "id": "<target environment id>",
        "linkType": "Environment",
        "type": "Link"
      }
    }
  },
  "items": [
    // <individual changeset items, see below>
  ]
}
```

The actual changes are in the `items` array. They have the following structure:
```javascript
// deleted
{
  "changeType": "deleted",
  "entity": {
    "sys": {
      "type": "Link",
      "linkType": "Entry",
      "id": "5mgMoU9aCWE88SIqSIMGYE"
    }
  }
}

// added
{
  "changeType": "added",
  "entity": {
    "sys": {
      "type": "Link",
      "linkType": "Entry",
      "id": "5mgMoU9aCWE88SIqSIMGYE"
    }
  },
  "data": {
    // <payload of added entry>
  }
}

// changed
{
  "changeType": "changed",
  "entity": {
    "sys": {
      "type": "Link",
      "linkType": "Entry",
      "id": "5mgMoU9aCWE88SIqSIMGYE"
    }
  },
  "patch": [
    // <individual patch operations for each change>
  ]
}
```
There are three different change types: `added`, `changed`, `deleted`.

- Changes of type `deleted` include `changeType` and `entity`, as seen above.

- Changes of type `changed` include an additional property `patch`, with an array of patch operations where content differs between environments.

- Changes of type `added` include an additional property `data` property with the usual Contentful entry payload.

If you want to see the data structure in practice, run the `create` command and have a look at the generated `changeset.json` file, or look at the [type definitions](src/engine/types.ts).

## FAQ

**I have access to the environments I provided, yet the CLI responds with a 404, what could be wrong?**

Make sure your CDA token has access to both environments, otherwise the CDA may respond with a 404.

**I have made draft changes in my environment, but I don't see those in the changeset.**

As the CDA is used to fetch and compare entries, only published changes will be taken into account. Draft changes are not available via the CDA.

**I have run the `create` command several times, but only see one `changeset.json` file created.**

Currently, the `changeset.json` file is overwritten everytime you run the `create` command in the same directory.

## What's next

Are you wondering what to do with the created changeset?
Our next step is to provide an `apply` command where you can apply the changeset to your target environment.
This will allow you to merge content from one environment to the other.

Stay tuned for [updates](https://www.contentful.com/developers/changelog/)!
